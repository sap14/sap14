## 💡 Dev Mindset

I’m always looking to push boundaries — whether it’s mastering Spring Boot internals or building clean Angular components. Here's what’s up lately:

- I’m deep-diving into **Kubernetes** and exploring **Container Orchestration**.
- Currently building **NextRead**. Your personal reading companion that helps you track, organize, and revisit your reading journey.
- Looking for folks to **collaborate on full stack apps**.
- Curious about how devs **approach CI/CD pipelines** — hit me up if you love DevOps!
- Looking to ahead to dip my toes into the world of app development.
- Fun fact? I believe a well-named variable is a love letter to your future self. ❤️
